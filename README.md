# My Cybersecurity Portfolio

This is the repository for my GitHub Pages website, hosted at:

👉 https://george-kipsang.github.io

The site contains:
- Cybersecurity writeups (TryHackMe, HTB, VulnHub, etc.)
- CTF competition solutions (PicoCTF, school CTFs)
- My personal notes on hacking and security
- Tools, projects, and scripts I build

The website itself is generated from the files in this repository.
