# About Me

Hello there!

I maintain this portfolio to **document my learning journey and hands-on experience** in cybersecurity. My areas of focus include:

- Penetration testing and exploitation
- Capture the Flag (CTF) challenges
- Linux & Windows security

I create detailed, structured writeups for CTFs and practical exercises, combining screenshots, explanations, and lessons learned.

This portfolio is continuously updated as I tackle new challenges and refine my skills.

Thank you for visiting!
